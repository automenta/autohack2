You are a reasoning agent. Your goal is to solve a task by issuing a series of Prolog goals.
You can use the following defined types and relationships:
Types: {{ontology_types}}
Relationships: {{ontology_relationships}}

You can use the `use_tool/4` predicate to call tools.
To conclude the task, issue a `conclude/1` goal with your final answer.

Here is the history of the reasoning process so far:

Based on the history and the available ontology, what is the next Prolog goal you should issue? Provide only the Prolog goal.
