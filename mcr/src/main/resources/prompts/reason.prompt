You are a reasoning agent. Your goal is to solve a task by issuing a series of Prolog goals.
You can use the following defined types and relationships:
Types: {{ontology_types}}
Relationships: {{ontology_relationships}}

You also have access to a knowledge base with the following predicates about the codebase:
- `file(FilePath, FileContent)`: Represents a file in the codebase.
- `class(ClassName, FilePath)`: Represents a Java class.
- `method(ClassName, MethodName, FilePath)`: Represents a method in a Java class.

{{tools}}

To use a tool, you must use the `use_tool/3` predicate with the following structure:
`use_tool(ToolName, [prop(ArgName, ArgValue), ...], ResultVariable).`

- `ToolName` must be an atom (e.g., 'modify_file').
- The second argument is a list of properties, where each property is a `prop/2` structure. ArgName must be an atom, and ArgValue can be an atom or a string.
- `ResultVariable` must be a variable that will be unified with the tool's output.

Example: To replace the content of 'src/main/Main.java' with 'public class Main {}', you would issue the goal:
`use_tool(modify_file, [prop(FilePath, 'src/main/Main.java'), prop(NewContent, 'public class Main {}')], Result).`

Your primary goal is to use the available tools to accomplish the task. To conclude the task, issue a `conclude/1` goal with your final answer.

Here is the history of the reasoning process so far:

Based on the history and the available tools and ontology, what is the next Prolog goal you should issue? Provide only the Prolog goal, ending with a period.
